Specifically, students will learn to recognize fallacies in logic; apply inductive and deductive reasoning strategies to the interpretation and development of persuasive communication; evaluate the validity of sources; and develop logically sound persuasive communication. Students will explore the roles of self-awareness, empathy, and ethics in the context of critical inquiry and the development of arguments.",

One way for businesses to protect themselves is to regularly check their networks and systems as though they were bad guys. These vulnerabilities are related to configuration problems, bad software development processes and a variety of other common issues. The process of checking your own infrastructure is called ethical hacking. Students will learn the importance of ethical hacking and practice common methodologies for performing a penetration test against systems in order to expose vulnerabilities. This will include common attacks against Web services and vulnerable systems using a variety of professional tools.",

In this state students can access helpful ideas and responses and be their best selves regardless of environment. Improving facility for conflict creates stronger relationships and reduces fear. By the end of the course, students will understand that disagreement and difference can become a source of personal and interpersonal growth.",

Some examples include digital archiving, data mining, and story mapping. In this course, we will use one or more digital methods or tools to research a topic, theme or question that varies by section, with the express purpose of critiquing and reflecting on its application. This includes an examination of the values, flaws, and impacts of the methods or tools we are using, paying particular attention to their ethical implications and power dynamics.

                "description": "When an organization introduces a change to a project, that change needs to be effectively managed through two lenses: technical and human/organizational. A technical focus ensures that the change is developed, designed, and delivered effectively. The discipline of project management provides the structure, processes and tools to make this happen. A human/organizational focus ensures that the change is embraced, adopted, and utilized by the employees who have to do their jobs differently as a result of the project. The discipline of change management provides the structure, processes, and too??ls to make this happen. Although each discipline can function independently, the most effective approach is to integrate change management and project management to create a unified approach to implementing change on both fronts.",

Students will evaluate security threats and vulnerabilities, using game theory principles. Studying game theory and the solutions to complicated scenarios helps cultivate a discipline to problem solving that assists security professionals in developing solutions to complicated problems. Since many security problems involve social engineering, game theory helps reduce those problems to something more quantifiable and actionable.",

                "description": "Malware is a global problem. Every year, hundreds of millions of new types of malware are unleashed on the world. It's a challenge for businesses to keep up with organizations investing in finding new ways of infecting and evading detection. Once a company has been infiltrated with a malware infection, it's essential to determine the source so as to close the hole. Students will learn detection techniques, infection vectors, static and dynamic analysis as well as how to construct a timeline to determine the initial infection in case of multiple pieces of malware on the same system.",

By the end of this course, students will be able to make use of branching scenarios, conditional decision making, and other programming concepts applied specifically to game development.",

A technical focus ensures that the change is developed, designed, and delivered effectively. The discipline of project management provides the structure, processes and tools to make this happen. A human/organizational focus ensures that the change is embraced, adopted, and utilized by the employees who have to do their jobs differently as a result of the project. The discipline of change management provides the structure, processes, and too??ls to make this happen. Although each discipline can function independently, the most effective approach is to integrate change management and project management to create a unified approach to implementing change on both fronts.",

As almost everything we encounter or do on a daily basis involves physics, whether it is obvious or not, this course is particularly useful for any future career. Many of the examples studied are very practical, and theory is used as an adjunct to the real-world problems investigated. Topics include measurement and error, vector quantities, translational and rotational motion, Newton?s laws, work energy and power, and properties of materials. Laboratory sessions are designed to re-enforce material presented in class as well as introduce students to laboratory procedures and the scientific method. In addition to Newtonian mechanics, we will investigate basic electronics and robotics and their connection to physics",
