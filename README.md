# Champlain API

## Explanation:
Currently there is no centralized API to access Champlain Collegeâ€™s data. A centralized API would provide easy access to this data. This enables developers and students to build solutions that improve campus experiences.


## Objectives: 
- Create a centralized API: This project should create a centralized API where information can be accessed. Public users, students, and faculty should be able to use the API.
- Offer a scalable solution: The API should be designed so that future integrations and endpoints can be easily added.

## Building the API
1. cd to the `api` folder
1. Install dependencies with `npm i`
2. Build with `npm run build`
3. Run using `npm run dev`
4. Visit http://localhost:3000/ in web browser.

## Building the documentation
1. Change directory to the `docs` folder
1. Install dependencies with `npm i`
1. Build with `npm run build`
1. Preview with `npm run preview`
1. Visit http://localhost:4173/ in a web browser

The API files are generated in `/docs/dist`
